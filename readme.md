# play-files
A library for parsing Polyend Play projects into Rust structs.


## TODO
Substantial:
- Do stuff with track files
- Midi Step parsing
- Parse `samplesMetadata`
- Lots of unknown `settings`
  - Figure out set of tags (or otherwise don't panic)
- Write files

Smaller:
- Unknown footer for Steps
- Unknown footer for Project files
